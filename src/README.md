To compile and run our project:
<ul>
<li><em><strong>javac main.java</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>java main.java</strong></em></li>
<p>To compile and run our project, compile the main
class and run the main class.</p>

<li><em><strong>javac ProductUnitTest.java</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>java ProductUnitTest.java</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>...</strong></em></li>
<p>Each class corresponds with a "UnitTest" class. These classes are meant to 
act as test cases for the class associated with them. To run these test cases, compile
the test classes and run the test classes.</p>

| Transaction          | <p>The <strong>Transaction</strong> class represents a transaction between a user and a seller.

However, we purposefully store everything as an int or String which is fixed instead of the product object or store object, as sellers may change their stores or prices which would then change the price of the past transaction.</p> | <p>Created a Transaction object and printed if each variable is equal to the expected output.</p><p>Used setters to set new variables and printed if every output matched the expected output.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
